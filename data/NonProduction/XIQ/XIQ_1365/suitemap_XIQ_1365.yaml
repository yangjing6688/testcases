    steps:
      - Create a network policy
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and
      - check Advanced Settings TAB is present in Configuration Menu
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB

    steps:
      - Create a network policy
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and check Advanced Settings TAB is
      - present in Configuration Menu
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB

      - Create a network policy
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and check Advanced Settings TAB is present in Configuration Menu
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB
      - There is a option for "Upgrade firmware to the latest version" and can be selected.
      - Then click Save button.
      - Check that after a device is onboarded and network policy is set, firmware is updated to the latest version.

    title: "Verify that Option for Upgrade to the specific device firmware version is present."
    steps: 
      - Create a network policy.
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and check Advanced Settings TAB is present in
      - Configuration Menu.
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB.
      - There is a option for "Upgrade to the specific device firmware version" and can be selected.Then click
      - Save button.
      - After selecting this option a list of firmware available should appear and user can choose one.
      - After selecting one firmware from the list, when a device is onboarded and network policy is set,
      - firmware will automatically update to the chosen firmware from the list.
      - "Check that the image list that are shown from the drop-down are based on the switch template that is
        a.	if the template selected is X440G2 then it should not list the Summit_arm/Summit_arm_lite/Onie/VOSS images.
        b.	If the template selected is 5320/5720 then it should list only the supported images by these platforms (it should not list all the summit _arm images)."

    title: "Verify that Toggle for Upload configuration automatically is present and off by default."
    steps:
      - Create a network policy
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and check if Advanced Settings TAB is present in Configuration Menu
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB
      - Check if "Upload configuration automatically" button is OFF by default and switch it to ON then click on Save button
      - Onboard an EXOS device and attach the network policy during onboarding 
      - check if the device has been onboarded and the configuration has been automatically pushed

    title: "Check that if the DUT is already onboarded and has a network policy, changing Upload configuration automatically or Upgrade device firmware upon device firmware authentication from off to on will not have any effect."
    steps:
      - Create a network policy
      - Onboard an EXOS device and attach the policy to it
      - In Device Template TAB select an EXOS switch template and check Advanced Settings TAB is present in Configuration Menu
      - Click on Advanced Settings TAB
      - Turn on the toggle for "Upload configuration automatically" and "Upgrade device firmware upon device firmware authentication"
      - Check that nothing happens since the expected behaviour is that the node_1 uploads automatically the firmware and the configuration only if the toggle for these options are already on before
      - Check the device is onboarded and the network policy applied.

      - Check that the firmware selected to upgrade is the same with the firmware that is already on node_1
      - Onboard the node_1 using the network policy configured.
      - Check that upgrade is not triggered since the image on the node_1 is the same as the one selected for upgrade.
